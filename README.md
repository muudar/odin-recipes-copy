# odin-recipes
This is my first Odin Project!

Although I already know how the fundamentals of web design and HTML/CSS/JavaScript, I figured it would be best to start odin project from the fundamentals because my knowledge was a bit scattered and un-organized.

The project will include my favourite recipes! Let's put our basic html knowledge to the test.
